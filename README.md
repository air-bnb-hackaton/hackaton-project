# Ironhack Hackathon! Yay!!!

Errorbnb is a project inspired by Ironhack Miami’s Hackathon, where our team of 7 is tasked to redesign and develop a Full-Stack application based on Airbnb’s site. We will be reimagining the filters landing page and the details listing page. The main focus of the project is to bring together the UX/UI designers, web developers and data scientists by designing, researching, developing, and deploying a revamped version of the site.
