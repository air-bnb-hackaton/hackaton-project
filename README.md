Hi all!

I'm scared and glad that we're doing this because we all know how programming is :grimacing::weary:Let's just say it's a lot like this picture. Exactly like it actually. I just hope we can push ourselves and each other through it.

So, first thing's first, we already created our GitHub repo for this project. Good job!

git add > git commit -m "message" > git pull > git push
